## Introduction

In this program we are going to find the person is eligible for voting or not.

## Example

If age of person is less than 18 then he/she will not be eligible for voting.

And if age is 18 or above then he/she will be able for voting.

## Program

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int age;
    printf("Enter your age\n");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    printf("You have entered %d as your age:\n", age);
    if(age>=18)
    {
        printf("Your age is greater than 18 so you are eligible for voting");
    }
    else 
    {
        printf("Your age is less than 18 so you are not eligible for voting");
    }

    return 0;
}
