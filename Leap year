# Introduction
 In this program we are going to find that given year is leap year or not.

# Condition

For leap year

When year divisible by both 400 and 4 must give 0 remainder. And when divisible by 100 must not give remainder 0, then the year said to be leap year.

Otherwise year is not leap year.

# Example

Year = 2012 is divisible by both 400 and 4 and give remainder 0 and when divisible
by 100, remainder is not 0. whereas,

year = 2014 is not leap year because it's remainder is not 0 when divisible by 400 and 4 both.
# Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int y;
    printf("Enter any year\n");
    scanf("%d", &y);
    
    if(y%400==0 || y%4==0 && y%100!=0)
    {
        printf("Year is leap year");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Year is not leap year");
    }
    

    return 0;
}
