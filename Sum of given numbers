# Introduction
In this program we are going to take numbers from users and add all given numbers using while loop.

# Example

Let's take any numbers 

say, 8453

Now add all given numbers,

8 + 4 + 5 + 3

= 20


# Program

We are going to print above result by doing programming.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int i, n, sum = 0,  remainder;
    printf("Enter the number to add\n");
    scanf("%d", &n);
     
    i = n;
    while(i != 0)
    {
        remainder = i % 10;
        sum = sum + remainder;
        i = i / 10;
    }
    printf("The sum of %d is %d", n, sum);

    return 0;
}
