# Swap Function
# Introduction
Swap function is used to swap two number. By using this function, we don't need any third variable to swap two number.

# For example
  Let's two number be a and b

  Before swaping, 
  
  a = x and b = y

  After swaping, 

  a = y  and b = x

# Program

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"Program to swap two number without using third variable"<<endl;
    cout<<endl;
    int a, b;
    
    cout<<"Enter the first number:"<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    
    cout<<"Enter the second number:"<<endl;
    cin>>b;
    
    cout<<"Value before swaping"<<endl;
    cout<<"First number = "<<a<<endl;
    cout<<"Second number = "<<b<<endl;
    cout<<endl;
    
    // Logic for swaping two numbers
    
    a = a + b;
    b = a - b;
    a = a - b;
    
    cout<<"Value After Swaping"<<endl;
    cout<<"First number = "<<a<<endl;
    cout<<"Second number = "<<b<<endl;
    
    
    return 0;
