# Compound Interest
# Introduction
Compound interest is the interest on a loan or deposit that accrues on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.

# Compound Interest Formula
 CI = P(1 + R/100)^T

 where, 

 P = is the principle amount

 T = is the time and

 R = is the rate


# Logic to calculate compound interest

Step by step descriptive logic to calculate compound interest.

1. Input principle amount. Store it in some variable say principle.

2. Input time in some variable say time.

3. Input rate in some variable say rate.

4. Calculate compound interest using formula, CI = principle * pow((1 + rate / 100), time).

5. Finally, print the resultant value of CI.



# Program to find CI

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main()
{
    float principle, rate, time, CI;

    /* Input principle, time and rate */
    printf("Enter principle (amount): ");
    scanf("%f", &principle);

    printf("Enter time: ");
    scanf("%f", &time);

    printf("Enter rate: ");
    scanf("%f", &rate);

    /* Calculate compound interest */
    CI = principle* (pow((1 + rate / 100), time));

    /* Print the resultant CI */
    printf("Compound Interest = %f", CI);

    return 0;
