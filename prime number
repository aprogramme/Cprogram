# Introduction
 In this program we are going to find the number is prime or not.

 Prime number is that number which divisible by only itself and 1.

# Example

 7 is a prime number because it is divisible by only itself and 1 not by any other numbers.

 whereas, 9 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 1, 3 and 9.
# Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int n, i, num = 0;
    printf("Enter any integer\n");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(i = 1; i<=n; i++)
    {
        if(n%i == 0)
        {
        num++;
        }
    }
    if(num == 2)
    {
        printf("Number is Prime");
        
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Number is not prime");
    }

    return 0;
}
