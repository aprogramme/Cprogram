# Introduction
 In this program we are going to find the greater number among the three numbers.



# Example

Let's say 

first number = 7

second number = 6

third number = 9

then, among the three third number is greater i.e., 9.
# Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int a, b, c;
    printf("Enter first number\n");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    
    printf("Enter second number\n");
    scanf("%d", &b);
    
    printf("Enter third number\n");
    scanf("%d", &c);
    
    
    if(a>b)
    {
        if(a>c)
        {
            printf("%d is greater among the three", a);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%d is greater among the three", c);
        }
    }
    
    else if(b>a)
    {
        if(b>c)
        {
            printf("%d is greater among the three", b);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%d is greater among the three", c);
        }
    }
    
    
    

    return 0;
}
