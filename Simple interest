# Simple Interest
# Introduction
In this program we are going to calculate simple Interest.


# Simple Interest Formula
 SI = (P * T * R) / 100

 where, 

 P = is the principle amount

 T = is the time and

 R = is the rate


# Logic to calculate simple interest

Step by step descriptive logic to calculate simple interest.

1. Input principle amount in some variable say principle.

2. Input time in some variable say time.

3. Input rate in some variable say rate.

4. Find simple interest using formula SI = (principle * time * rate) / 100.

5. Finally, print the resultant value of SI.




# Program to find SI

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    float principle, time, rate, SI;

    /* Input principle, rate and time */
    printf("Enter principle (amount): ");
    scanf("%f", &principle);

    printf("Enter time: ");
    scanf("%f", &time);

    printf("Enter rate: ");
    scanf("%f", &rate);

    /* Calculate simple interest */
    SI = (principle * time * rate) / 100;

    /* Print the resultant value of SI */
    printf("Simple Interest = %f", SI);

    return 0;
}
