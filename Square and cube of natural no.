# Introduction
# Square and cube of first natural number.

In this program we are  going to find out the square and cube of natural number entered by users.




# Example

Let's take first 5 natural number.

1.  sq = 1, cube = 1

2. sq= 4,  cube = 8

3. sq = 9, cube = 27

4. sq = 16, cube = 64

5. sq = 25, cube = 125
# Program

We are going to print above result by doing programming.

#include <stdio.h>


int main()

{
    
    int i,n;
    printf("Enter the value of n\n");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("No. \tSquare \tCube\n");
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        
        printf("%d \t%d \t%d \t\n", i, i*i, i*i*i);
    }

    return 0;
}
