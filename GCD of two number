# Introduction
In this program we are goint to take two numbers from users to print GCD value.

# Example

let's first number be 4 and second be 6

Factor of 4 = 1, 2, 4

Factor of 6 = 1, 2, 3, 6

common factor = 1 and 2

Highest common factor = 2

So, 

GCD of 4 and 6 is 2.







# Program

We are going to print above result by doing programming.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int a, b, H;
    printf("Enter two numbers\n");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    for(H = a<b? a : b; H>= 1; H--)
    {
        if(a % H == 0 && b % H == 0)
        break;
    }
    
    printf("The GCD is %d", H);
    

    return 0;
}
