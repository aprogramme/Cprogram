# Introduction

In this program we are going to find out addition,  subtraction, product, divide and modulus of two number in 
C++.


## For example

 Let first number is 'a = 4' and second is 'b = 6'. 
 Addition = a + b = 10

Subtraction = a - b =  -2

Multiply = a * b = 24

Divide = a / b = 0

Modulus = a % b = 4




## Program

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    int sum, difference,product, division;
    float qoutient;
    
    cout<<"Enter first number\n";
    cin>> x;
    cout<<"Enter second number\n";
    cin>> y;
    
    sum = x + y;
    difference = x - y;
    product = x * y;
    division = x / y;
    qoutient = x % y;
    
    cout<<"\nsum ="<<sum;
    cout<<"\nDifference ="<<difference;
    cout<<"\nProduct ="<<product;
    cout<<"\nDivision ="<<division;
    cout<<"\nQuotient ="<<qoutient;

    return 0;
}
