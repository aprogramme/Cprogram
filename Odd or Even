# Introduction

In this program we are going to find the number is even or odd.

# Example

If number is divisible by 2 and give 0 remainder then that number is EVEN,

and if remainder is not equal to 0 then, the number is ODD.
# Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int a;
    printf("Enter a number:\n");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("The number is:\n");
    if(a%2==0)
    {
        printf("Even");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Odd");
    
    }

    return 0;
}
