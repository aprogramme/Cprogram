# Introduction
 In this program we are going to entered the score of 4 subject by user and give their result according to their result.



# Example

Let's say total score is 400.

If score is greater than 350, then the student is passed by first division.

if score is greater than 200 and less than 350 then he got second division.

if score is between 200 and 150 the third division and

if score is less than 150 then he is fail.
# Program
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4, total;
    printf("Enter score of sub1\n");
    scanf("%d", &sub1);
    
    printf("Enter score of sub2\n");
    scanf("%d", &sub2);
    
    printf("Enter score of sub3\n");
    scanf("%d", &sub3);
    
    printf("Enter score of sub4\n");
    scanf("%d", &sub4);
    
    total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3 + sub4;
    printf("Total score is %d\n", total);
    
    if(total>350)
    {
        printf("You got first division");
    }
    else if(total>200)
    {
        printf("You got second division");
    }
    else if(total>150)
    {
        printf("You got third division");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("You are fail");
    }
    

    return 0;
}
