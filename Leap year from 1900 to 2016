# Introduction
  In this program we are going to see the list of leap year from 1900 to 2016.




# Example

Leap year between 1900 to 2016 are:

1904, 1908, 1912, 1916, 1920, 1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1940,  1944, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960,
1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 


# Program

We are going to print above result by doing programming.

#include <stdio.h>



int main()

{
    
    int i;
    printf("List of leap years from 1900 to 2016 are as follow:\n");
    
    for(i = 1900; i <= 2016; i++)
        {
            if(i%400==0 || i%4==0 && i%100!=0)
            {
                printf("%d\n", i);
            }
        }
    
    return 0;
}
